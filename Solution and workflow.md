# Solution and workflow

Intital thoughts after reading brief:
    - Task 1: Shouldn't take long, the use of the multiprocessing library will be needed
    - Task 2: Actually had to perform backward propagation by hand during an exam in May
    - Task 3: Unfamiliar with `Interval Bound Propagation (IBP)`, might need to research before I can complete the task

## Task 1:
    - Recieved a Type Error when passing arguments to `pd.read_csv()` in pool.starmap(), will create a util function to handle the arguments
    - Managed to get a working solution, output comapred to SingleProccessDataset:
    
    ```
    Running main.py...
    Loading data using single process...
    Dataset loading completed in 0.01 seconds
    Loading data using multi process...
    Dataset loading completed in 4.25 seconds
    ```

## Task 2:


## Task 3:
